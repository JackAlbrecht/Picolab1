# Picolab1

Hi everyone!

This repository is for my Engineering 151 class where we are using pi picos to do some fun stuff!
This is the first lab of the course, and includes 2.1, 2.2, and stoplight, which are all python files.
Stoplight is coded to have a green and red light at 5 second intervals and a yellow light at 2 second intervals, all in a loop.
2.2 is to demonstrate toggle() compared to value()
2.1 is my first python code.

Task 3 & 5 are for Eric Davashal to grade my task responses.

Thanks!
