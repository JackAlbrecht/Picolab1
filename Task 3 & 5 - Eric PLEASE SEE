# stoplight
Task 3:
1: The difference between led_onboard.value() and led.toggle() is that “value” will allow you to input 1 or
0, 1 means that the led will be on, 0 means that the led will be off, whereas “toggle” will change from 
value 0 to value 1 depending on the sleep time. 
The difference between led_onboard and led lies in the fact that led is an outside led, and led_onboard 
is the onboard light within the pi pico.

2: The purpose of the 220 ohm resistor in the LED circuit is because the LED only would like 2.0v but the 
pi outputs 3.3v, therefore we need to get the voltage down to 2v using the 220 ohm resistor which will 
remove 1.3 volts from the system. The LED will still work but it will burn out over time without a resistor.

Task 5:
This circuit could be used in a real-world device, such as a stop light at an intersection. 
This device wouldn’t currently act as a stoplight however, due to the hard coded values for stop, yield, and go lights. 
To create a more applicable device for the real world it would be necessary to include more input, instead of only output. 
The goal would be to collect data about where cars are on the road to determine when a light should switch.

First I would connect a motion sensor to the microcontroller.
Using the sensory to generate a value of (1/0) depending on if there is motion detected or not.
Next it will be important to compute total motion on our side of the road as well as the opposite side, divided by the 2 perpendicular lights 
to the right and left. 
If we found that there was more motion from the perpendicular lights then the light would be green until motion is no longer detected OR 
30 seconds has passed, at which point the opposite lights will switch and will use the same rules.
